.SH "NAME"
XDP-bench \- a simple XDP benchmarking tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
XDP-bench is a benchmarking utility for exercising the different operation modes
of XDP. It is intended to be a simple program demonstrating the various
operating modes; these include dropping packets, hairpin forwarding (using the
\fIXDP_TX\fP return code), and redirection using the various in-kernel packet
redirection facilities.

.PP
The drop and TX modes support various options to control whether packet data is
touched (read or written) before being dropped or transmitted. The redirection
modes support using the simple ifindex-based \fIbpf_redirect\fP helper, the
\fIbpf_redirect_map\fP helper using a cpumap as its target, \fIbpf_redirect_map\fP using
a devmap as its target, and the devmap's broadcast mode which allows redirecting
to multiple devices.

.PP
There is more information on the meaning of the output in both default (terse)
and extended output mode, in the \fBOutput Format Description\fP section below.

.PP
Each command, and its options are explained below. Or use \fIxdp\-bench COMMAND
\-\-help\fP to see the options for each command.
.SH "The DROP command"
.PP
In this mode, \fIxdp\-bench\fP installs an XDP program on an interface that simply
drops all packets. There are options to control what to do with the packet
before dropping it (touch the packet data or not), as well as which statistics
to gather. This is a basic benchmark for the baseline (best-case) performance of
XDP on an interface.

.PP
The syntax for the \fIdrop\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench drop [options] <ifname>\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname>\fP is the name of the interface the XDP program should be
installed on.

.PP
The supported options are:
.SS "-p, --packet-operation <ACTION>"
.PP
Specify which operation should be taken on the packet before dropping it. The
following actions are available:

.RS
.nf
\fCno-touch		- Drop the packet without touching the packet data
read-data		- Read a field in the packet header before dropping
parse-ip		- Parse the IP header field before dropping
swap-macs		- Swap the source and destination MAC addresses before dropping
\fP
.fi
.RE

.PP
Whether to touch the packet before dropping it can have a significant
performance impact as this requires bringing packet data into the CPU cache (and
flushing it back out if writing).

.PP
The default for this option is \fIno\-touch\fP.
.SS "-l, --load-mode <MODE>"
.PP
Specify which mechanism xdp-bench should use to load (and store) the packet data.
The following modes are available:

.RS
.nf
\fCdpa		- Use traditional Direct Packet Access from the XDP program
load-bytes	- Use the xdp_load_bytes() and xdp_store_bytes() helper functions
\fP
.fi
.RE

.PP
This can be used to benchmark the various packet access modes supported by the
kernel.

.PP
The default for this option is \fIdpa\fP.
.SS "-r, --rxq-stats"
.PP
If set, the XDP program will also gather statistics on which receive queue index
each packet was received on. This is displayed in the extended output mode along
with per-CPU data (which, depending on the hardware configuration may or may not
be equivalent).
.SS "-i, --interval <SECONDS>"
.PP
Set the polling interval for collecting all statistics and displaying them to
the output. The unit of interval is in seconds.
.SS "-e, --extended"
.PP
Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in
"terse" mode. The output mode can be switched by hitting C-$\ while the program
is running. See also the \fBOutput Format Description\fP section below.
.SS "-m, --mode"
.PP
Selects the XDP program mode (native or skb). Note that native XDP mode is the
default, and loading the redirect program in skb manner is neither performant,
nor recommended. However, this option is useful if the interface driver lacks
native XDP support, or when simply testing the tool.
.SS "-v, --verbose"
.PP
Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from the
underlying \fIlibxdp\fP and \fIlibbpf\fP libraries.
.SS "--version"
.PP
Show the application version and exit.
.SS "-h, --help"

.SH "The PASS command"
.PP
In this mode, \fIxdp\-bench\fP installs an XDP program on an interface that passes
all packets to the network stack after processing them (returning \fIXDP_PASS\fP).
There are options to control what to do with the packet before passing it
(touch the packet data or not), as well as which statistics to gather. This is a
basic benchmark for the overhead of installing an XDP program on an interface
while still running the regular network stack.

.PP
The syntax for the \fIpass\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench pass [options] <ifname>\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname>\fP is the name of the interface the XDP program should be
installed on.

.PP
The supported options are:
.SS "-p, --packet-operation <ACTION>"
.PP
Specify which operation should be taken on the packet before passing it. The
following actions are available:

.RS
.nf
\fCno-touch		- Pass the packet without touching the packet data
read-data		- Read a field in the packet header before passing
parse-ip		- Parse the IP header field before passing
swap-macs		- Swap the source and destination MAC addresses before passing
\fP
.fi

be equivalent).
.SS "-i, --interval <SECONDS>"
.PP
Set the polling interval for collecting all statistics and displaying them to
the output. The unit of interval is in seconds.
.SS "-e, --extended"
.PP
Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in
"terse" mode. The output mode can be switched by hitting C-$\ while the program
is running. See also the \fBOutput Format Description\fP section below.

.SH "The TX command"
.PP
In this mode, \fIxdp\-bench\fP installs an XDP program on an interface that performs
so-called "hairpin forwarding", which means each packet is transmitted back out
the same interface (using the \fIXDP_TX\fP return code).. There are options to
control what to do with the packet before transmitting it (touch the packet data
or not), as well as which statistics to gather.

.PP
The syntax for the \fItx\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench tx [options] <ifname>\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname>\fP is the name of the interface the XDP program should be
installed on.

.PP
The supported options are:
.SS "-p, --packet-operation <ACTION>"
.PP
Specify which operation should be taken on the packet before transmitting it. The
following actions are available:

.RS
.nf
\fCno-touch		- Transmit the packet without touching the packet data
read-data		- Read a field in the packet header before transmitting
parse-ip		- Parse the IP header field before transmitting
swap-macs		- Swap the source and destination MAC addresses before transmitting
\fP
.fi
.RE

.PP
To allow the packet to be successfully transmitted back to the sender, the MAC
addresses have to be swapped, so that the source MAC matches the network device.
However, there is a performance overhead in doing swapping, so this option
allows this function to be turned off.

.PP
The default for this option is \fIswap\-macs\fP.
.SS "-l, --load-mode <MODE>"
.PP
Specify which mechanism xdp-bench should use to load (and store) the packet data.
The following modes are available:

.SH "The REDIRECT command"
.PP
In this mode, \fIxdp\-bench\fP sets up packet redirection between the two
interfaces supplied on the command line using the \fIbpf_redirect\fP BPF helper
triggered on packet reception on the ingress interface.

.PP
The syntax for the \fIredirect\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench redirect [options] <ifname_in> <ifname_out>\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname_in>\fP is the name of the input interface from where packets will
be redirect to the output interface \fI<ifname_out>\fP.

.SS "-s, --stats"
.PP
Enable statistics for successful redirection. This option comes with a per
packet tracing overhead, for recording all successful redirections.
.SS "-e, --extended"
.PP
Start xdp-bench in "extended" output mode. If not set, xdp-bench will start in
"terse" mode. The output mode can be switched by hitting C-$\ while the program

.SH "The REDIRECT-CPU command"
.PP
In this mode, \fIxdp\-bench\fP sets up packet redirection using the
\fIbpf_redirect_map\fP BPF helper triggered on packet reception on the ingress
interface, using a cpumap as its target. Hence, this tool can be used to
redirect packets on an interface from one CPU to another. In addition to this,
the tool then supports redirecting the packet to another output device when it
is processed on the target CPU.

.PP
The syntax for the \fIredirect\-cpu\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench redirect\-cpu [options] <ifname> \-c 0 ... \-c N\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname>\fP is the name of the input interface from where packets will be
redirect to the target CPU list specified using \fI\-c\fP.

.PP
The supported options are:
.SS "-c, --cpu <CPU>"
.PP
Specify a possible target CPU index. This option must be passed at least once,
and can be passed multiple times to specify a list of CPUs. Which CPU is chosen
for a given packet depends on the value of the \fI\-\-program\-mode\fP option,
described below.
.SS "-p, --program-mode <MODE>"
.PP
Specify a program that embeds a predefined policy deciding how packets are
redirected to different CPUs. The following options are available:

.RS
.nf
\fCno-touch		- Redirect without touching packet data
touch		- Read packet data before redirecting
round-robin	- Cycle between target CPUs in a round-robin fashion (for each packet)
l4-proto		- Choose the target CPU based on the layer-4 protocol of packet
l4-filter		- Like l4-proto, but drop UDP packets with destination port 9 (used by pktgen)
l4-hash		- Use source and destination IP hashing to pick target CPU
l4-sport		- Use modulo of source port to pick target CPU
l4-dport		- Use modulo of destination port to pick target CPU
\fP
.fi
.RE

.PP
The \fIno\-touch\fP and \fItouch\fP modes always redirect packets to the same CPU (the
first value supplied to \fI\-\-cpu\fP). The \fIround\-robin\fP and \fIl4\-hash\fP modes
distribute packets between all the CPUs supplied as \fI\-\-cpu\fP arguments, while
\fIl4\-proto\fP and \fIl4\-filter\fP send TCP and unrecognised packets to CPU index 0, UDP
packets to CPU index 1 and ICMP packets to CPU index 2 (where the index refers
to the order the actual CPUs are given on the command line).

.PP
The default for this option is \fIl4\-hash\fP.
.SS "-r --remote-action <ACTION>"
.PP
If this option is set, a separate program is installed into the cpumap, which
will be invoked on the remote CPU after the packet is processed there. The
action can be either \fIdrop\fP or \fIpass\fP which will drop the packet or pass it to
the regular networking stack, respectively. Or it can be \fIredirect\fP, which will
cause the packet to be redirected to another interface and transmitted out that
interface on the remote CPU. If this option is set to \fIredirect\fP the target
device must be specified using \fI\-\-redirect\-device\fP.

.PP
The default for this option is \fIdisabled\fP.
.SS "-r, --redirect-device <IFNAME>"
.PP
Specify the device to redirect the packet to when it is received on the target CPU.
Note that this option can only be specified with \fI\-\-remote\-action redirect\fP.

.SH "The XSK-DROP and XSK-TX commands"
.PP
In these modes, xdp-bench drops or mirrors incoming packets (like when using the
\fIdrop\fP or \fItx\fP commands), but using an \fIAF_XDP\fP socket that passes the packets
directly from the XDP hook to userspace. These modes can be used to test and
benchmark \fIAF_XDP\fP sockets. The two commands differ only in the action taken -
the syntax and options are otherwise identical.

.PP
The code for these commands are derived from the \fIxdpsock\fP utility previously
part of the kernel sources, and more recently the bpf-examples repository. The
\fIxsk\-drop\fP command corresponds to the \fI\-\-rxdrop\fP option of \fIxdpsock\fP, and the
\fIxsk\-tx\fP command corresponds to the \fI\-\-l2fwd\fP command of \fIxdpsock\fP.

.PP
The syntax and options for the two commands are identical:

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench xsk\-drop [options] <ifname>\fP

.PP
or

.PP
\fIxdp\-bench xsk\-tx [options] <ifname>\fP

.PP
The supported options are:
.SS "-q, --queue <queue>"
.PP
Select the hardware receive queue to use for the test. The \fIAF_XDP\fP socket is
bound to this queue, which means that \fIxdp\-bench\fP will process all packets
arriving on it. The default is to use queue 0.
.SS "-i, --interval <seconds>"
.PP
Set the polling interval for collecting all statistics and displaying them to
the output. The default interval is 2 seconds.
.SS "-f, --frame-size <size>"
.PP
Set the size of the memory frames used to receive packets. Incoming packets will
always use a memory chunk of this size, regardless of the size of the packet on
the wire. The size must be a power of two, unless the \fI\-\-unaligned\fP flag is
used. The default is 4096 bytes (which corresponds to the page size on most
systems).
.SS "-d, --duration <seconds>"
.PP
Set the test duration, in seconds. The default is 0 (run forever).
.SS "-b, --batch-size <packets>"
.PP
Set the batch size for the receive loop. This is the maximum number of packets
processed at once each time the loop runs. The default is 64 packets.
.SS "-I, --irq-string <irq-string>"
.PP
Enable printing of interrupt statistics for the interrupt number associated with
\fIirq\-string\fP in /proc/interrupts. The string is used to find a matching IRQ
number by simple substring matching. No default (which means no IRQ statistics
are printed).
.SS "-p, --poll"
.PP
Use the \fIpoll()\fP system call to get notifications for new packets, instead of
running in a loop constantly checking for new packets.
.SS "-m, --no-need-wakeup"
.PP
Don't set the \fIXDP_USE_NEED_WAKEUP\fP flag when binding the \fIAF_XDP\fP socket. The
flag is set by default, and causes the kernel driver to occasionally go to sleep
and yield the CPU to the userspace application when receiving packets.
.SS "-u, --unaligned"
.PP
Support receiving unaligned packets, i.e., packets that are not aligned to the
beginning of a data frame. When set, \fIxdp\-bench\fP will enable huge pages for the
userspace memory buffer used to receive packets. Setting this option enables
frame sizes that are not a power of two (see the \fI\-\-frame\-size\fP option).
.SS "-M, --shared-umem"
.PP
Enable shared userspace memory across multiple \fIAF_XDP\fP sockets. When this
option is set, \fIxdp\-bench\fP will create four sockets that share the same
userspace memory buffer, and packets will be sent to each socket in a
round-robin fashion.
.SS "-x, --extra-stats"
.PP
Print extra packet statistics at each output interval.
.SS "-Q, --quiet"
.PP
Don't print any statistics at each output interval.
.SS "-a, --app-stats"
.PP
Print additional application-level statistics at each output interval.
.SS "-B, --busy-poll"
.PP
Set the \fISO_PREFER_BUSY_POLL\fP socket option, which enables the application to
busy-poll without IRQs ever being enabled on the hardware queue being processed.
To make use of this option, the \fInapi_defer_hard_irqs\fP and \fIgro_flush_timeout\fP
sysctls should be set for the interface in question. For more information, see
\fIhttps://docs.kernel.org/networking/napi.html#software-irq-coalescing\fP.
.SS "-F, --frags"
.PP
Enable XDP fragments. This makes it possible to receive packets that are larger
than the system page size, and requires kernel and driver support.
.SS "-C, --copy-mode <mode>"
.PP
Select the copying mode for the packets. Set to one of \fIauto\fP, \fIcopy\fP, or
\fIzero\-copy\fP. The default is \fIauto\fP, which lets the kernel pick. Using zero-copy
requires kernel and driver support, and can only be used when attaching the XDP
program in native mode (see \fI\-\-attach\-mode\fP).
.SS "-w, --clock <clock>"
.PP
Choose the clock that will be used for all timer events in the application. The
valid values are MONOTONIC, REALTIME, TAI and BOOTTIME, and the default is
MONOTONIC.
.SS "-W, --policy <policy>"
.PP
Set the scheduler policy for the application before running. Valid values are
\fISCHED_OTHER\fP and \fISCHED_FIFO\fP, and the default is \fISCHED_OTHER\fP.
.SS "-U, --schpri <priority>"
.PP
Set the scheduler priority when using \fISCHED_FIFO\fP. Defaults to 0.
.SS "-A, --attach-mode <mode>"
.PP
Set the XDP program attach mode (native or skb). The default is native mode.
Note that zero-copy can only be used in native mode.
.SS "-v, --verbose"
.PP
Enable verbose logging. Supply twice to enable verbose logging from the
underlying \fIlibxdp\fP and \fIlibbpf\fP libraries.
.SS "--version"
.PP
Show the application version and exit.
.SS "-h, --help"
.PP
Display a summary of the available options
.SH "Output Format Description"
.PP
By default, redirect success statistics are disabled, use \fI\-\-stats\fP to enable.
The terse output mode is default, extended output mode can be activated using
the \fI\-\-extended\fP command line option.

.PP
SIGQUIT (Ctrl + \\) can be used to switch the mode dynamically at runtime.

.PP
Terse mode displays at most the following fields:
.RS
.nf
\fCrx/s		Number of packets received per second
redir/s	Number of packets successfully redirected per second
err,drop/s	Aggregated count of errors per second (including dropped packets when not using the drop command)
xmit/s	Number of packets transmitted on the output device per second

\fCFIELD		  DESCRIPTION
receive	       Displays the number of packets received and errors encountered

                        Whenever an error or packet drop occurs, details of per CPU error
                        and drop statistics will be expanded inline in terse mode.
                                        pkt/s		- Packets received per second
                                        drop/s		- Packets dropped per second
                                        error/s		- Errors encountered per second
                                        redirect	- Displays the number of packets successfully redirected
                       Errors encountered are expanded under redirect_err field
                       Note that passing -s to enable it has a per packet overhead
                                        redir/s		- Packets redirected successfully per second


redirect_err	  Displays the number of packets that failed redirection

                        The errno is expanded under this field with per CPU count
                       The recognized errors are:
                                        EINVAL:		Invalid redirection
                                        ENETDOWN:	Device being redirected to is down
                                        EMSGSIZE:	Packet length too large for device
                                        EOPNOTSUPP:	Operation not supported
                                        ENOSPC:		No space in ptr_ring of cpumap kthread

                                        error/s		- Packets that failed redirection per second


enqueue to cpu N Displays the number of packets enqueued to bulk queue of CPU N
                       Expands to cpu:FROM->N to display enqueue stats for each CPU enqueuing to CPU N
                       Received packets can be associated with the CPU redirect program is enqueuing
                       packets to.
                                        pkt/s		- Packets enqueued per second from other CPU to CPU N
                                        drop/s		- Packets dropped when trying to enqueue to CPU N
                                        bulk-avg	- Average number of packets processed for each event


kthread	       Displays the number of packets processed in CPUMAP kthread for each CPU
                       Packets consumed from ptr_ring in kthread, and its xdp_stats (after calling
                       CPUMAP bpf prog) are expanded below this. xdp_stats are expanded as a total and
                       then per-CPU to associate it to each CPU's pinned CPUMAP kthread.
                                        pkt/s		- Packets consumed per second from ptr_ring
                                        drop/s		- Packets dropped per second in kthread
                                        sched		- Number of times kthread called schedule()

                       xdp_stats (also expands to per-CPU counts)
                                        pass/s		- XDP_PASS count for CPUMAP program execution
                                        drop/s		- XDP_DROP count for CPUMAP program execution
                                        redir/s		- XDP_REDIRECT count for CPUMAP program execution


xdp_exception	  Displays xdp_exception tracepoint events

                        This can occur due to internal driver errors, unrecognized
                       XDP actions and due to explicit user trigger by use of XDP_ABORTED
                       Each action is expanded below this field with its count
                                        hit/s		- Number of times the tracepoint was hit per second


devmap_xmit      Displays devmap_xmit tracepoint events

                        This tracepoint is invoked for successful transmissions on output
                       device but these statistics are not available for generic XDP mode,
                       hence they will be omitted from the output when using SKB mode
                                        xmit/s		- Number of packets that were transmitted per second
                                        drop/s		- Number of packets that failed transmissions per second
                                        drv_err/s	- Number of internal driver errors per second
                                        bulk-avg	- Average number of packets processed for each event

Earlier xdp-redirect tools were written by Jesper Dangaard Brouer and John
Fastabend. They were then rewritten to support more features by Kumar Kartikeya
Dwivedi, who also ported them to xdp-tools together with Toke Høiland-Jørgensen.
This man page was written by Kumar Kartikeya Dwivedi and Toke Høiland-Jørgensen.
