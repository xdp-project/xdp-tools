.TH "xdp-trafficgen" "8" "FEBRUARY  3, 2023" "V1.2.2" "An XDP-based traffic generator" 

.SH "NAME"
XDP-trafficgen \- an XDP-based traffic generator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
XDP-trafficgen is a packet generator utilising the XDP kernel subsystem to
generate packets transmit them through a network interface. Packets are
dynamically generated and transmitted in the kernel, allowing for high
performance (millions of packets per second per core).

.PP
XDP-trafficgen supports generating UDP traffic with fixed or dynamic destination
ports, and also has basic support for generating dummy TCP traffic on a single
flow.

.SS "Running xdp-traffigen"
.PP
The syntax for running xdp-bench is:

.RS
.nf
\fCUsage: xdp-trafficgen COMMAND [options]

COMMAND can be one of:
       udp         - run in UDP mode
       tcp         - run in TCP mode
\fP
.fi
.RE

.PP
Each command, and its options are explained below. Or use \fIxdp\-trafficgen COMMAND
\-\-help\fP to see the options for each command.

.SH "The UDP command"
.PP
The UDP command generates UDP traffic to a given destination IP and either a
fixed destination port, or a range of port numbers. Only IPv6 traffic is
supported, and the generated packets will have their IP hop limit set to 1, so
they can't be routed.

.PP
The syntax for the \fIudp\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-trafficgen udp [options] <ifname>\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname>\fP is the name of the destination interface that packets will be
transmitted on. Note that the network driver of this network interface must
support being the target of XDP redirects (it must implement the \fIndo_xdp_xmit\fP
driver operation).

.PP
The supported options are:

.SS "-m, --dst-mac <mac addr>"
.PP
Set the destination MAC address of generated packets. The default is to generate
packets with an all-zero destination MAC.

.SS "-M, --src-mac <mac addr>"
.PP
Set the source MAC address of the generated packets. The default is to use the
MAC address of the interface packets are transmitted on.

.SS "-a, --dst-addr <addr>"
.PP
Destination IP address of generated packets. The default is the link-local
\fIfe80::2\fP address.

.SS "-A, --src-addr <addr>"
.PP
Source IP address of generated packets. The default is the link-local \fIfe80::1\fP
address.

.SS "-p, --dst-port <port>"
.PP
Destination UDP port of generated packets, or the first port in the range if
running with \fI\-\-dyn\-ports\fP set. Defaults to 1.

.SS "-P, --src-port <port>"
.PP
Source UDP port of generated packets. Defaults to 1.

.SS "-d, --dyn-ports <num ports>"
.PP
Enable dynamic port mode where the destination port is varied over a range of
\fI<num ports>\fP starting from the \fI\-\-dst\-port\fP.

.SS "-n, --num-packets <port>"
.PP
Number of packets to send before exiting. If not supplied, \fIxdp\-trafficgen\fP will
keep sending packets until interrupted.

.SS "-t, --threads <threads>"
.PP
Number of simultaneous threads to transmit from. Each thread will be pinned to a
separate CPU core if possible. Defaults to 1.

.SS "-I, --interval <s>"
.PP
Output transmission statistics with this interval (in seconds).

.SS "-v, --verbose"
.PP
Enable verbose logging (-vv: more verbose).

.SS "--version"
.PP
Display version information and exit.

.SS "-h, --help"
.PP

.SH "The TCP command"
.PP
The TCP command generates dummy TCP traffic in a single TCP flow. This relies on
first installing an ingress XDP program on the interface used to transmit on.
Then, a regular TCP socket connection is established from userspace, and once
the handshake is completed, the XDP program will take over and start generating
traffic on that flow tuple. The ingress XDP program will intercept ACK packets
from the receiver, and keep track of the receive window.

.PP
The traffic generator has no congestion control, and only very basic retransmit
tracking: in essence, any duplicate ACKs from the receiver will cause the sender
to reset its send sequence number to the last ACKed value and restart from
there. The same thing happens if no progress on the window is made within two
seconds. This means that the traffic generator can generate a large amount of
dummy traffic, but if there's packet loss a lot of this can be retransmissions.

.PP
The syntax for the \fItcp\fP command is:

.PP
\fIxdp\-trafficgen tcp [options] \-i <ifname> <hostname>\fP

.PP
Where \fI<ifname>\fP is the name of the destination interface that packets will be
transmitted on and \fI<hostname>\fP is the peer hostname or IP address to connect to
(only IPv6 is supported). Note that the network driver of this network interface
must support being the target of XDP redirects (it must implement the
\fIndo_xdp_xmit\fP driver operation).

.PP
The supported options are:

.SS "-p, --dst-port <port>"
.PP
Connect to destination <port>. Default 10000.

.SS "-m, --mode <mode>"
.PP
Load ingress XDP program in <mode>; default native (valid values: native,skb,hw)

.SS "-n, --num-packets <port>"
.PP
Number of packets to send before exiting. If not supplied, \fIxdp\-trafficgen\fP will
keep sending packets until interrupted.

.SS "-I, --interval <s>"
.PP
Output transmission statistics with this interval (in seconds).

.SS "-v, --verbose"
.PP
Enable verbose logging (-vv: more verbose).

.SS "--version"
.PP
Display version information and exit.

.SS "-h, --help"
