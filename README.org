* xdp-tools - Utilities and example programs for use with XDP

This repository contains a collection of utilities and example code to be used
with the eXpress Data Path facility of the Linux kernel.

For a general introduction to XDP, please see the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial][XDP tutorial]]. Some of the
example code in this repository is derived from the tutorial, but packaged to be
easier to re-use.

The repository contains the following:

- [[xdp-filter/][xdp-filter/]] - a simple packet filtering utility powered by XDP
- [[headers/xdp/][headers/xdp/]] - reusable eBPF code snippets for XDP (installed in /usr/include/xdp by =make install=).
- [[lib/util/][lib/util/]] - common code shared between the different utilities
- [[packaging/][packaging/]] - files used for distro packaging
- lib/libbpf/ - a git submodule with [[https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf][libbpf]], used if the system version is not recent enough

To compile, first run =./configure=, then simply type =make=. Make sure you
either have a sufficiently recent libbpf installed on your system, or that you
pulled down the libbpf git submodule (=git submodule init && git submodule
update=).
